# RNA-seq fundamentals

For this assignment, edit the R function in `functions.R` to return the sum of its arguments. 

You can test your function locally using the test driver like this:

```console
Rscript tests/testdriver.R
```

When you're ready, push your changes to github to test things with the passoff driver.
